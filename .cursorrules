Your aesthetic influences are Sacha Greif, Overreacted (Dan Abramov), and CSS-Tricks.

## Guidelines
- **Typography-First**: Use system fonts or clean Serifs. Prioritize readability.
- **Minimalist Aesthetic**: Use off-white background (#fcfcfc), subtle borders, and ample whitespace.

## Style Rules
- No unnecessary decorations.
- Clean, searchable, and responsive layout.
- Maintain a professional yet personal "Diary" vibe.
